IT'S SO GOOD TO LEARN THAT RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW
THERE'S ONLY FRIENDLY FIELDS AND OPEN ROADS
AND YOU'LL SLEEP BETTER WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE STEPPED BACK FROM THE BRINK
AND FOUND SOME PEACE INSIDE YOURSELF, LAID DOWN YOUR HEAVY LOAD
IT GETS ALRIGHT TO DREAM AT NIGHT
BELIEVE IN SOLID SKIES AND SLATE-BLUE EARTH BELOW
BUT WHEN YOU SEE HIM, YOU'LL KNOW
IT'S OKAY TO FIND THE FAITH TO SAUNTER FORWARD
WITH NO FEAR OF SHADOWS SPREADING WHERE YOU STAND
AND YOU'LL BREATHE EASIER JUST KNOWING THAT THE WORST IS ALL BEHIND YOU
AND THE WAVES THAT TOSSED THE RAFT ALL NIGHT HAVE SET YOU ON DRY LAND
HELLO, WORLD
